# The Challenge
In this interview challenge question, given an unsorted ArrayList of numbers, solve for the following and print them to the console:
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Range

## An Example Problem
#### A program is set up such that it prompts a user to input double values into an ArrayList. Given that the user inputted the values {3.0, 4.2, -5.1, 11.2, 0.0, 1.01}, _calculate the **mean, median, and range** of the contents of the ArrayList_. 


To solve such a problem, one must be familiar with the mathematical formulas for mean, median, and range:
* The **mean** is the _average_ value of the elements in the set, or the sum of all elements divided by the number of elements.
* The **median** is the _middle_ element in the set when arranged in ascending or descending order. If the set has an even number of elements, then the median is the _mean_ of the two middle elements. 
* The **range** is the difference between the largest and smallest elements of the set.
